# DeX Explorer
![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AZYsGithub/DexPlusPlus/main/preview.png)

DeX Explorer is an extended version of Moon's Dex, made to fulfill some Moon's Dex prophecy.

## Latest Version Script
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/FusionWTF/Dex-Explorer/releases/download/Beta/out.lua"))()
```
For specific versions, go to [releases](https://github.com/FusionWTF/DeX-Explorer/releases).

## What's the difference between Dex and DeX Explorer?
Since the original Dex is the last release and Moon have discontinued it, it still has some missing features.
Here are the features that were added/fixed in DeX Explorer
- Using New Roblox Studio Icons
- Updated API
- Uses Konstant as fallback decompiler (for shitsploits who doesn't have it)
    > 'getscriptbytecode' is required
- Uses [USSI](https://github.com/luau/UniversalSynSaveInstance/tree/main) as fallback saveinstance
- Mobile Input Support (Window drag, resizing works fully on touch)
- Console Output
- Model Viewer (basically 3D Preview)
- Revived Save Instance (original Dex doesnt have it, but does in Dex 2.0)
- Click part to select 
- CodeFrame cursor offset (where cursor on textbox were not aligned properly)

## To Build
1. Download this repository
2. Ensure you have Python 3 (I use 3.9.0)
3. Run build.py
4. The executable script will be created as out.lua

## About Dex Roadmap
The concept of the Dex roadmap is amazing, however neither me nor Moon have the ability to fulfil the full roadmap. I did have added few stuffs in my fork but mostly of them are beyond my limit and i did this project for fun.
